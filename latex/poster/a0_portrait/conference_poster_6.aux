Considering that the size of the pooling images and the number of them, we make them smaller by resizing the images and merge them into one image. By comparing the two images, The region of fish are brighter than other regions in the most of the pooling images, which can prove that the fish has more influence on the classification than other regions.\relax }}{1}}
